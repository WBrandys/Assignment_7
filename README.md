# Assignment_7 

This repository contains an assignment that based on **Iris dataset**.

There are two files:
- `exercise 7.qmd` — The Quarto source file containing R code and explanations.
- `exercise 7.html` — The HTML report.

In this assignment I:
- Transformed the Iris dataset into a long format
- Calculated *mean length* and *width* of the *sepal* and *petal* of each species
- Identified the *largest* and *widest*, petal and sepal of *virginica* and *versicolor*.
- Counted the number of observations above the mean for each species, for petal and sepal width and length.
